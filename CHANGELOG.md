## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Runtime`: a complete `std.Io` on io_uring, with stackful tasks, work stealing or `per_core`, a home thread the root never leaves, a zero-thread profile driven by `run`, and four lanes (`sync`, `lookup`, `wait`, `general`) of owned `Io.Threaded` for calls that can block.
- `Loop`: one thread's completion engine with a timing wheel, completions by callback or `reap`, and `run(.nowait/.once/.within/.until)`.
- epoll and kqueue backends: calls made at once and on readiness, descriptors registered once, `real` and `boot` timers on kernel timers; `.auto` falls back to epoll where io_uring is unavailable. `Loop.start` takes an operation's result at once when it needs no wait; `Loop.closing` announces a close made elsewhere.
- The monitor (`Options.monitor`, `spares`, `handoff_after`, `report_after`): a worker stuck in a blocking file call hands its processor to a spare thread; stalls are counted in `stats`.
- IOCP backend (Windows): socket calls as AFD's own requests through a completion port, the port skipped for calls that complete at once; pipes and device control overlapped; child waits and `real` timers through wait completion packets; sleeps on a high-resolution waitable timer; `Loop.Options.port` and `Loop.complete` to share a host's port.
- Tasks on Windows: a switch that keeps the thread information block's stack bounds, and stacks that grow by guard page.
